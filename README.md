# ITR_Seq2 pipeline manual

This pipeline guideline was initiated by: Qi Zheng (<zhengqi@pennmedicine.upenn.edu>).

This manual is for the updated ITR_Seq2 pipeline.

We thank Kelly Martins (<kelly.martins@pennmedicine.upenn.edu>) and Jenny Greig (<greg@upenn.edu>) for their help of understanding the original ITR_Seq pipeline.

ITR sequencing assay is a method to identify genome-wide DNA editing sites *in vivo* following the adeno-associated viral vector-mediated genome editing.

## Dependency and pre-requirement
You need working Perl and Java distributions and available in your *PATH* to run this pipeline.
Both Perl and Java are generally available under most model Operation Systems,
including Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix/Linux, and is likely pre-install on most Unix/Linux based systems.

Besides, this pipeline also depends the following programs/tools pre-installed and available in your *PATH*.

If you are running this pipeline on PMACS HPC, all the following dependencies are pre-installed and pre-configured,
so you can ignore this step and jump to the next step.

1. **Samtools** - basic tool for manipulating standard alignment files in SAM/BAM format.
You can download and install **Samtools** by following the instructions at <https://www.htslib.org/>.

2. **Bowtie2** - Default NGS read aligner used by this pipeline.
You can download and install **Bowtie2** by following the instructions at <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml>.

3. **Cutadapt** - Cutadapt finds and optionally removes or marks adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails
and other types of unwanted sequence from your high-throughput sequencing reads.
You can download and install **Cutadapt** by following the instructions at <https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/>.

4. **Picard tools** - Picard is a set of Java based command line tools for manipulating high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data and formats such as SAM/BAM/CRAM and VCF.
This pipeline ships a JAR copy of **Picard tools** with it, but you can replace it with your own copy, you can achieve this by
simply download and replace the latest `picard.jar` file from https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ in this pipeline.

5. **Je** - tool suite used for removing PCR/UMI duplication (dedup) in NGS alignments.
You can download and install **Je** by following the instructions at <https://github.com/gbcs-embl/Je>.
 
## Getting Started

This pipeline's scripts only "prepare" the running commands (cmds) and output them into the shell/bash files.
After running these "prepare" scripts, you will need to run them either by directly execute the output files,
or "submitting" them via an LSF system such as `bsub` that is available on PMACS/HPC.
The "prepare" scripts will also check whether the output files already exist,
and if yes, it will not override the existing files and instead generate "commented-out" commands that you can feel free to enable/disable them manually.

**Note:** If you are using this pipeine in an HPC environment, be sure to do any of these steps in an interactive node,
initiated by typing `bsub -Is "bash"`.

### Create the experimental design config file

You need to create a special tab-delimited config file to specify all the experimental designs for a given project (**PROJECT_ID**).
You should do this by copying the template file `Template_ITR_Seq_experimental_design.conf` in this pipeline into your working directory,
and fill/edit it with a text-editor or Excel/Libre-Office,
and save it in tab-delimited format to your working directory (assuming it is saved as `PROJECT_ID_EXP_DESIGN.conf`)
 
Each project-specific config file contains global options and per-sample local options,
both are explained in the "comment lines" at the beginning of the template,
while the global options are in all upper-cases, and the values are given in **GLOBAL\_OPT=GLOBAL\_VAL** format,
and local options are given in corresponding table cells.

**Note:** If you are setting any of the working dir options below to values other than the current dir (./),
you will have to create or link the directories manually before running this pipeline.
